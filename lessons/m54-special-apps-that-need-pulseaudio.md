I have to give these programs a special place for some of you who do not use PulseAudio.

+ Skype - A VOIP client
+ Kazam - A screen recorder

### 1. Skype as VOIP client

Here is the detail instruction from Debian to install the latest Skype:

### 2. Kazam as screen recording app

[https://launchpad.net/kazam](https://launchpad.net/kazam)

My freelancer job requires a lot of short videos demonstrating how my scripts work. I use Kazam for the task.

Kazam is easier to use, let you choose one from various installed microphones, records the screen nicely with great output (small size and in HD resolution).

All instructing videos of this website are recorded using Kazam too.
```
sudo apt-get install kazam
```
