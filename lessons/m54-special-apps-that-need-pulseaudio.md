I have to give these programs a special place because some people do not use PulseAudio.

+ Skype - A VOIP client
+ Kazam - A screen recorder

### 1. Skype as VOIP client

Here is the detail instruction from Debian to install the latest Skype:

### 2. Kazam as screen recording app

[https://launchpad.net/kazam](https://launchpad.net/kazam)

My freelancer job (writing scripts) requires a lot of short videos demonstrating how my scripts work. I use Kazam for the task.

Kazam is easier to use, lets you choose one from various available microphones, records the screen nicely with great output (small size and in HD resolution).

All instructing videos of this website are recorded using Kazam too.
```bash
sudo apt-get install kazam
```
