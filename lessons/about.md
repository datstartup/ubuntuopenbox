# Why this website?

Hi, I am Dat from Vietnam.

I learned Linux as a hobby years ago and eventually using it on everything I can (my PC, my Notebook and my Raspberry Pis).

This site is created out of the love of Debian and Openbox. (The though of "who am I to write this kind of tutorial?" is always lurking at the back of my mind, but writing it has been a journey of pure joy.)

I have also received a lot of encouraging emails. They are all great sources of motivation. Please do not hesitate to share your thoughts on the Facebook page: [facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox](https://www.facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox)

Or contact me through this Google form: [https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/contact/](https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/contact/)

Hope you will enjoy your read and found the information helpful!

# Why Ubuntu?

Because it is one of the most recognizable name in Operating System world (also a big name in Linux world). Although eventually, I recommend Debian for its stability.

# Why Openbox?

Because
:
 * Openbox is Awesome: minimal and rock solid!

 * To busting the myth of "how the components of your Ubuntu system work together".

 * A Window Manager gives you only the “boxes” on the screen, so there will be spaces for customization.

# Who are the target readers?

For those who are seeking the way to install an OS with only the packages they want (i.e the customizing way!).

And, for those who have been using pre-configured operating systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE...) and want to play more with Linux.

HAPPY PLAYING!
