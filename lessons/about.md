# Why this website?

Hi, I am Dat from Vietnam.

I learned Linux as a hobby years ago and eventually use it on everything I can (my PC, my Notebook and my Raspberry Pis). I know how clueless it is to enter the Linux world.

YOU WILL NEED THIS KIND OF GUIDE AS THE STARTING POINT.

I have also received a lot of encouraging emails. They are all great sources of motivation. Please do not hesitate to share your thoughts on the Facebook page: [facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox](https://www.facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox)

Or contact me through this Google form: [https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/contact/](https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/contact/)

Hope you will enjoy your reading and find the information helpful!

# Why Ubuntu?

Because it is one of the most recognizable names in the Operating System world. However, I recommend Debian for its stability though.

THE STABLE OF DEBIAN WILL AMAZE YOU. Your tool computer will just work for YEARS!

# Why Openbox?

Because:

 * Openbox is awesome, minimal and rock solid!

 * A Window Manager gives you only the â€œboxes'' on the screen, so there will be spaces for customization.  Seeing how the components of a Linux system work together will benefit you to own your OS.

# Who are the target readers?

For those who are seeking the way to install an OS with only the packages they want (i.e the customizing way!).

And, for those who have been using pre-configured operating systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE...) and want to learn more with Linux.

HAPPY PLAYING!
