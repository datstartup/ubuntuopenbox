# Why this website?

Hi, I am Dat from Vietnam.

I learned Linux as a hobby years ago and eventually using it on everything I can (my PC, my Notebook and my Raspberry Pis).

This site is created out of the love for Debian and Openbox. (The though of "who am I to write this kind of tutorial?" is always lurking at the back of my mind, writing it has been a journey of pure joy.)

I have also received a lot of encouraging emails. They are a great sources of motivation. Please do not hesitate to share your thoughts on the Facebook page: [facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox](https://www.facebook.com/ubuntuopenbox)

Or contact me through this Google form: [https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/contact/](https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/contact/)

Hope you will enjoy your read and found the information helpful!

# Why Ubuntu?

Because it is one of the most recognizable name in Operating System world.

# Why Openbox?

First and foremost: Openbox is Awesome!;
Next:

To busting a bit of the myth of "how the components of your Ubuntu system work together".

A Window Manager gives you the “boxes” on the screen in which your programs will run, so there will be space for your creativity.

Linux OS is modular and to choose which packages for your own OS is a great experience.

# Who are the target readers?

For those who are seeking the way to install a Operating System containing only the packages they want (i.e the customizing way!).

The target readers of this website had better be using pre-configured Linux operating systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE...) and had a general idea of what Linux was.

HAPPY READING!
