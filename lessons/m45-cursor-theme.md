The cursor theme I use called **Breeze** - a series of beautiful cursor themes.

You can found it here:

It comes with various color patterns and sizes, for left hand and right hand:

To install a cursor theme in Openbox:

Download the theme package, extract it into **~/.icon/** folder on your home directory.

Open **lxappearance** > **Mouse cursor** tab > find the set of **Breeze** cursor you desire > **apply**. You need to restart your system for the change to take effect globally (system wide) because cursor theme cannot be changed on the fly.
