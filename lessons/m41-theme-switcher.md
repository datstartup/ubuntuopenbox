In this lesson I will show you the nuts and bolts of how to configure the look of an Openbox desktop.

We will need two programs: **Lxapperance** is for changing Gtk theme, icon theme and cursor theme; and **Obconf** is for changing Openbox theme.

[**screenshots**]({{site.baseurl}}/screenshots.html){:target="_blank"}.
Above are my current set up.

In case you are not agree my choices of theme and icons, you can easily create another look for yours. There will be plenty space for the aesthetic sense to kick in.

About composite, because my installation has minimalism in its natures, I try to avoid any visual effect. So, the Ubuntu Openbox of this guide will not have that feature.

First, in this lesson I will install gtk and Openbox theme switchers. Then I will show you how to change themes using them (taskbar theme, Openbox theme, icon theme, gtk theme, cursor theme) in the next lessons.

## Install theme swichers:

The easiest way to changing theme and icon in Openbox is using a theme switcher. They are **Lxappearance** and **Obconf**.
* Lxapperance is for changing Gtk theme, icon theme and cursor theme.
* Obconf is for changing Openbox theme.

To install them:
```
sudo apt-get install lxappearance obconf
```
## lxappearance
[![lxappearance]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lxappearance.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lxappearance.png){:target="_blank"}

## obconf
[![obconf]({{site.baseurl}}/images/obconf.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/obconf.png){:target="_blank"}
