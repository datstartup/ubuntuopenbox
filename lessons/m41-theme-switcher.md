You will need two programs to configure the look of an Openbox desktop:
* **Lxapperance** is for changing Gtk theme, icon theme and cursor theme; and
* **Obconf** is for changing the Openbox theme.

Skim through this galery for my current setup:
[**Galery**]({{site.baseurl}}/gallery/){:target="_blank"}.

In case you do not agree with my choices of theme and icons, there will be plenty of space for your aesthetic sense to kick in.

## Install theme swichers:

The easiest way to change theme and icon in Openbox is using a theme switcher. They are **Lxappearance** and **Obconf**.
* Lxapperance is for changing Gtk theme, icon theme and cursor theme.
* Obconf is for changing the Openbox theme.

To install them:
```bash
sudo apt-get install lxappearance obconf
```
## lxappearance
[![lxappearance]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lxappearance.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lxappearance.png){:target="_blank"}

## obconf
[![obconf]({{site.baseurl}}/images/obconf.png)]({{site.baseurl}}/images/obconf.png){:target="_blank"}

I will show you how to change themes using **lxpapperance** and **obconf** (taskbar theme, Openbox theme, icon theme, gtk theme, cursor theme) in upcoming lessons.
