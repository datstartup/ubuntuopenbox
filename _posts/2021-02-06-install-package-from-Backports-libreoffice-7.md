Backports are repositories that have packages from newer sources (Testing and Sid) compiled so that it can work on older Debian versions.

The risk of backports is actually slightly greater than using testing and Sid since apart from just not going through enough tests, it might break a Debian stable.
 
I was eager to try out the Libreoffice 7 on my Debian and I know that the sort of â€œnewest" apps will be in the backports repository.

## 1. Add Buster Backport source

Add this line to my Debian `sources.list` file
```shell
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
```
Then
```shell
sudo apt update
```
## 2. Install Libreoffice on Debian
I have show how to install Libreoffice here on this website: [https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/lessons/m53-office-apps-for-ubuntu-openbox/#1-libreoffice-as-office-suite](https://www.ubuntuopenbox.com/lessons/m53-office-apps-for-ubuntu-openbox/#1-libreoffice-as-office-suite)

The process is the same.
```shell
sudo apt-get install libreoffice-calc libreoffice-writer libreoffice-gtk3 libreoffice-style-sifr
```
It will update my libreoffice packages on my system.
