I find these following shortcut keys essential.

# 1. Multiple cursors

Hold `ctrl` + using mouse to select where to add cursors.

# 2. Select multiple text (and automatically add cursors)

Double click to select the first + hold `ctrl` + double click others to select more.

# 3. Select many similar texts (change variable name at many place at once)

Place the cursor at the text + `ctrl + D` to select it, then `ctrl + D` again to select the next instance of the text. Repeat to select more.

# 4. Join lines

`ctrl + J` at where I want to join.

# 5. Delete line (even blank line)

`ctrl + X`.

# 6. Move line (place the cursor somewhere in the line)/ block of lines (highlight them first)

`ctrl + shift + up/down`.

# 7. Dublicate a line

Place the cure sure somewhere in the line, then `ctrl + shift + D`

# 8. Indent/ unindent

`ctrl + ] / ctrl + [`

# 9. Toggle between commenting out and uncommenting

`ctrl + /`.

# 10. Open/ search file in current project folder

`ctrl + P`, then search for its name.

# 11. Place multi-cursors at the end or begin of the lines

Select lines (Clrl + A) to select all.

`Ctrl + Shilf + L` to enable cursor. Or you can manually enable multi-cursor using `Hold Ctrl + Left-click`.
`Home` or `end` to move cursors to begin or end of lines.
