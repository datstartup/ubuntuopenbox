I find these following shortcut keys essential.

# Multiple cursors 

Hold `ctrl` + using mouse to select where to add cursors.

# Select multiple text (and automatically add cursors)

Double click to select the first + hold `ctrl` + double click other to select more

# Select many similar texts (change variable name at variable place as one) 

Place the cursor at the text + `ctrl + D` to select it, then `ctrl + D` again to select the next instance of the text. Repeat to select more.

# Join line

`ctrl + J` at where I want to join.

# Delete line (even blank line)

`ctrl + X`.

# Move line (place the cursor somewhere in the line)/ block of lines (highlight them first)

`ctrl + shift + up/down`

# Dublicate a line

Place the cure sure some where in the line, then `ctrl + shift + D`

# Indent/ disindent

`ctrl + ] / ctrl + [`

# Open file in current open project

`ctrl + P`, then search for its name.
