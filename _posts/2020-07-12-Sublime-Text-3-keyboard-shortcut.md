I find these following shortcut keys essential.

# 1.Multiple cursors 

Hold `ctrl` + using mouse to select where to add cursors.

# 2.Select multiple text (and automatically add cursors)

Double click to select the first + hold `ctrl` + double click others to select more.

# 3.Select many similar texts (change variable name at variable place as one) 

Place the cursor at the text + `ctrl + D` to select it, then `ctrl + D` again to select the next instance of the text. Repeat to select more.

# 4.Join lines

`ctrl + J` at where I want to join.

# 5.Delete line (even blank line)

`ctrl + X`.

# 6.Move line (place the cursor somewhere in the line)/ block of lines (highlight them first)

`ctrl + shift + up/down`.

# 7.Dublicate a line

Place the cure sure some where in the line, then `ctrl + shift + D`

# 8.Indent/ unindent

`ctrl + ] / ctrl + [`

# 9. Toggle between commenting out and uncommenting

`ctrl + /`.

# 10.Open file in current open project

`ctrl + P`, then search for its name.
