Oh my bash: a frame work of Bash shell and extends its ability to install plugin and theme.

I am not using Bash that much, so I use it just for the theme.

### 1. Install

Its repository here:

[https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash "oh-my-bash repository")

How to install oh-my-bash as guided in the repository:

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Set theme

Oh-my-bash come prebuilt with several themes. To preview them, go to its theme wiki: [https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/wiki/Themes](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/wiki/Themes "Oh-my-bash theme's wiki").

To use this `agnoster` theme, edit the `~/.bashrc` file, then look for an environment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:

```
OSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

I also recommend this awesome font to go with the "agnoster" theme: `hack`. I find it best suit with the color arrow.

Hack font's homepage: [https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/ "Hack font's Homepage").

Here is how my terminal emulators look after setting the theme.

Tilda

### 3. Set Terminus (Sublime Text 3) to use Hack font

Preferences => Package Settings => Terminus => Setting

Add this to the user setting:

```
{
  "view_settings":
    {
      "font_face": "Hack",
      "font_size": 14,
    },
}
```
