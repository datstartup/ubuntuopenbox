## Why Ubuntu?

Because it is one of the most recognizable name in Operating System world (also a big name in Linux world). Although eventually, I recommend Debian for its stability.

## Why Openbox?

Because:

   * Openbox is awesome, minimal and rock solid!

   * To busting the myth of “how the components of your Ubuntu system work together”.

   * A Window Manager gives you only the “boxes” on the screen, so there will be spaces for customization.

## Who are the target readers?

Who are seeking the way to install an OS with only the packages they want (i.e the customizing way!).

And, for those who have been using pre-configured operating systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Debian, openSUSE…) and want to play more with Linux.

## Screenshots of Ubuntu/ Debian Openbox in action

Openbox is not just practical but its look is also modern.
