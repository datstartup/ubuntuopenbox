Welcome to the Fifty Days Habit Tracker app!


This is an Android app developed by Dat Nguyen. The app is also available on Google Play.

As an internet user, I take privacy very seriously. This app does not collect any of your data. The only permission it asks you is for accessing the folder storing your audiobooks.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data and app preferences are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,

Dat Nguyen
